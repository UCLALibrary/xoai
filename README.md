# XOAI

What is XOAI?

XOAI is the most powerful and flexible OAI-PMH Java Toolkit (initially developed by Lyncode). XOAI contains common Java classes allowing to easily 
implement OAI-PMH data and service providers.

--- 
:warning: **XOAI IS NOT ACTIVELY MAINTAINED:**  The DSpace project adopted XOAI when the original creator had to abandon it. However, XOAI currently doesn't have a "product owner" or any funding for active support. DSpace itself still uses XOAI v3 (see [3.x branch](https://github.com/DSpace/xoai/tree/3.x)), and has yet to proritize an upgrade to the latest version of XOAI. Therefore, this project only receives attention/updates when someone from the DSpace team can prioritize it.

If you'd like to contribute or help maintain this project, please get in touch via an issue ticket.

_Until this notice is removed, those looking for a more updated XOAI may wish to consider using one of these forks:_
* Dataverse project: https://github.com/gdcc/xoai
